# Pathfinder

## Add this feature:
Your friend doesn't have their car on Tuesdays, so you need to drive them home.

### Acceptance criteria
- The concept of "day of the week" will need to be introduced.
- On Tuesdays, you _always_ drive your friend home via a new carpool route.
- The carpool route is similar to the car route, but with a detour through your friend's neighborhood to drop them off.

### Implementation
Add this behavior in both implementations of the app, noticing where you need to make changes.
